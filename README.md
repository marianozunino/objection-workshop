</details>
Tags:

1. Basic structure, linter, prettier, tsconfig. Basic dependencies: `knex, objection and sqlite3`
2. `Knexfile` and some migrations.
3. Config folder, `KnexFile` now extends from our project config.
4. Add some seeds
5. DatabaseFactory. Singleton which handles the model binding with Knex and creates the Db connection.
6. Models. Basic models that represent the schema (no relationship yet).
7. Add a BaseEntity to avoid DRY.
8. Hooks. Pre Save/Update hooks. Example with auditing (createdAt/updatedAt)
9. Parse SQLite timestamp into JS Date using parseDatabaseJson hook.
10. Relationships.
11. Repositories with DI.
12. Service/Main with DI. This shows how we can graph insert data, graph relate, and graph fetch.
